# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
This application aims to help answer the eternal question, What's for dinner? Based on the user's selected meal category - Sides, Mains, or Desserts - the application randomly proposes a meal to alleviate decision fatigue. Not happy with the proposed option? Randomize again until you find a meal that sounds appealing. The app comes pre-loaded with over 40 meal options plus the ability to add, edit or delete meal options to suit your tastes. Built using CSS Flexbox, the responsive app design works on a range of viewports.

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
This project was completed during my third week of learning at the Turing School over the course of 6 days (~23 hours). At that point, I had a couple weeks of Javascript experience and was just beginning my journey with HTML and CSS.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
- Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Understand how to listen to and respond to user events
- After the base app (Homepage with meal randomizer) is completed, add an additional feature of your choice (All Recipes page with add/edit/delete functionality)

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
This was my very first app built from scratch using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Given how new I was with using CSS and HTML, it was a win to implement consistent styling that matched with the provided comp without sacrificing functionality. I'm proud of how thoughtful I was about the user experience and potential edge cases. For example, I chose to disable specific buttons until the user fulfilled necessary requirements; Edit and Delete are disabled until a user has selected a meal from the list, and a meal cannot be manually added until the user gives it a name. There is also built-in data validation to ensure meals cannot be duplicated within the same category list. Though these features added complexity and working time, I felt that they were important to include.
